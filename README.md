# Hack-a-Thing-2

## Explanation
I attempted to embellish a basic game on Unity in order to understand Unity, it's tutorials, and basic game design, which I had never looked at before this. I did it alone and found it to be very rewarding.

* What I learned: How Unity works and a little of how game development works.
* I'm confident that if I'm on a team that wants to build a game, I (with good tutorials and resources) can pick it up, which I could not have said before this.
* What didn't work: I spent time building a virtual machine and attempting to code with Swift on MacOS, but it fell flat. Unity also had some trouble running on my laptop at first, but after I changed a few settings it seemed to work out. I was really nervous my computer wouldn't handle it for a little while.
